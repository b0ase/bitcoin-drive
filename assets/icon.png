# This is a placeholder for the app icon
# In a real deployment, you would replace this with:
# - icon.png (256x256 or higher for Linux)
# - icon.ico (for Windows)
# - icon.icns (for macOS)
#
# You can create these icons from a PNG image using online converters
# or tools like electron-icon-builder
